## Transaction Fees & The Mempool

- Block Space as Real Estate: Why users must outbid each other for a spot in the next 1MB block.

- Mempool Visualization: Using tools like Mempool.space to see "congestion" and determine the optimal sat/vB (satoshis per virtual byte) rate.

- RBF (Replace-By-Fee): How to "bump" the fee of a stuck transaction to move it to the front of the line.

- CPFP (Child Pays For Parent): A technique where the recipient pays a high fee for a new transaction to "pull" a stuck parent transaction through.

- The Future of Fees: How miners will eventually be paid entirely by fees once the block reward hits zero in the year 2140.
