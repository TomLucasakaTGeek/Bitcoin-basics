# Day 10: Multi-sig and Programmable Money

**Bitcoin Script:** A stack-based language (similar to Forth) that allows for conditional spending (e.g., "Spend only if 2 of 3 people sign").

**P2SH (Pay to Script Hash):** How complex conditions are hidden behind a simple address until the moment the funds are spent.

**Time-Locks (CLTV/CSV):** Coding transactions that cannot be spent until a certain date or block height (the basis for Lightning).

**Escrow Services:** How 2-of-3 multi-sig allows for trustless e-commerce where a mediator only steps in if there is a dispute.

**The Vault Concept:** Using multi-sig and time-locks to create ultra-secure cold storage that is resistant to immediate theft.
