# Day 12: Routing and Liquidity in LN

**The Gossip Protocol (LN):** How nodes map out the entire network to find a "path" from Sender to Receiver through intermediate hops.

**Inbound vs. Outbound Liquidity:** The "Abacus" problem—you cannot receive 100 sats if all your sats are already on your side of the channel.

**Channel Management:** The art of "balancing" channels using circular rebalancing or submarine swaps.

**Routing Fees:** How node runners earn a small commission (in millisats) for facilitating the flow of capital across the network.

**LSP (Lightning Service Providers):** Modern services that automatically provide "inbound" liquidity to new users so they can receive payments immediately.
