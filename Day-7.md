## The Mining Lifecycle & Difficulty Adjustment

- The Nonce: The "Number used once" that miners change trillions of times per second to find a valid block hash.

- Target and Bits: How the network sets a "target" value that the block hash must be lower than to be considered valid.

- Difficulty Adjustment: The "magic" of Bitcoin—how the network automatically gets harder or easier every 2,016 blocks to keep block times at 10 minutes.

- ASICs: The evolution from CPU/GPU mining to specialized hardware designed solely for SHA-256 calculations.

- Mining Pools: How individual miners combine their hash power to smooth out rewards and compete with giant industrial farms.
