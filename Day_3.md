# Data Structures: The Chain in Blockchain
- The Block Header: Examining the six components (Version, Prev Hash, Merkle Root, Time, Bits, Nonce) that define a block's identity.

- Merkle Trees: A mathematical structure that hashes all transactions in a block into a single "root," allowing nodes to verify a single transaction without downloading the whole block.

- Chaining Blocks: How each block contains the hash of the previous one, creating a "chain" that makes altering past data computationally impossible.

- The Genesis Block: Analyzing "Block 0" and the message Satoshi embedded in it regarding bank bailouts.

- Block Body: Understanding how transactions are ordered and stored within the 1MB–4MB effective limit.
