# The Network Layer (Nodes & Gossip Protocol)
- **Full Nodes:** Why running a node (like Bitcoin Core) is the only way to independently verify the total supply and validity of transactions.

- **The Gossip Protocol:** How nodes find peers and broadcast information using a "flooding" algorithm to ensure the whole world sees a transaction in seconds.

- **Initial Block Download (IBD):** The process a new node goes through to sync the entire history of Bitcoin from 2009 to the present.

- **Pruned Nodes:** How nodes can save disk space by deleting old block data while still maintaining the ability to verify new transactions.

- **Peer Discovery:** How the network remains resilient by using DNS seeds and hardcoded IP addresses to find the first few peers.
