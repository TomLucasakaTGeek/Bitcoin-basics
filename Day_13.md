# Day 13: Lightning Protocols: WebLN & LNURL

**WebLN Standard:** How a browser extension (like Alby) acts as a bridge, allowing websites to request a "zap" or payment without a QR code.

**LNURL-Pay:** A protocol that allows for "static" QR codes—perfect for streamers or creators to receive tips without generating a new invoice every time.

**LNURL-Withdraw:** The "reverse" payment—a QR code that, when scanned, pushes money into your wallet (used for faucets or ATM withdrawals).

**LNURL-Auth:** Using your Lightning wallet to log into websites securely, replacing traditional (and hackable) username/password combinations.

**The User Experience Gap:** How these protocols take the "scary math" of Bitcoin and turn it into a seamless "Click-to-Pay" experience.
