# Blockchain Basics and how its tamper-proof
- A blockchain is built safe by design following various protocols and security measures, let's take the example of Bitcoin, the first and most popular blockchain.
- Bitcoin is built on a decentralized network, where there is no central server and each node making up the ecosystem can act both as a client and as a server.
- Bitcoin is a collection of blocks🟨, each linked🔗 to its predecessor through a cryptographic hash. This cryptographic link makes it impossibler to tamper with.
- Each block contains data about current timestamp, transactions data and cryptographic hash of the previous block. Bitcoin-specific components like - Target and Nonce.
- Another way of preventing any control over blockchain like - 51% attack, Bitcoin selects the Longest Chain with most Computation work according to its Longest Chain Rule.
