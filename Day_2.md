# Cryptographic Foundations (Hashing & Signatures) and how its tamper-proof
- **SHA-256 Hashing:** Understanding the "One-Way" function where any input produces a fixed 256-bit string; this is the bedrock of data integrity.

- **Asymmetric Cryptography:** Learning how a Private Key (which must never be shared) generates a Public Key via Elliptic Curve Mathematics.

- **Digital Signatures (ECDSA):** How a sender "signs" a transaction to prove they own the funds without ever revealing their private key to the network.

- **Address Generation:** The process of hashing a public key to create a human-readable Bitcoin address (Base58 or Bech32).

- **Collision Resistance:** Why it is mathematically impossible for two different inputs to produce the same hash, preventing fraudulent data injection.
