# Basics of Bitcoin and How it revolutionized payment systems

## History, Foundations and Objectives
- Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, enabling Peer-to-Peer Fund Transfer, eliminating the need for any intermediary.
- It was built upon following a research over timestamping documents - "How to Timestamp a document" by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.
- Bitcoin was designed to maintain a record of transactions, that are transparent, publicly verifiable and immutable over a decentralized network.
- A blockchain in particular was designed to be a system of distributed, decentralized [no central server] nodes that validate all the transactions.
- Any blockchain ecosystem aims to develop a system where the people from the ecosystem validate all the transactions, eliminating need for financial institutions.
