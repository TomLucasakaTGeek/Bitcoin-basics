# Basics of Bitcoin and How it revolutionized payment systems

## History, Foundations and Objectives
- Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, enabling Peer-to-Peer Fund Transfer, eliminating the need for any intermediary.

- It was built upon research over timestamping documents—specifically "How to Timestamp a Digital Document" by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.

- Bitcoin was designed to maintain a record of transactions that are transparent, publicly verifiable, and immutable over a decentralized network.

- A blockchain specifically acts as a system of distributed nodes that validate all transactions without a central server.

- The primary objective is to develop an ecosystem where participants validate transactions, removing reliance on traditional financial institutions.
